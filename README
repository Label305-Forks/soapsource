Requirements :

PHP5 with Soap extension enabled
Cakephp 1.2
A SOAP server with wsdl support

Usage :

Copy the soap_source.php file to your app/modules/datasources/ directory

Add a configuration to your database.php in app/core/

var $soap = array(
    'datasource' => 'soap',
    'wsdl' => 'http://localhost/soapservice.wsdl'
);

Then in your model set:

var $useDbConfig = 'soap';

var $useTable = false;

And you're ready to go.

In your controller you can now use

$this->Model->query('SoapMethod', array('mySoapParams'));

or

$this->Model->SoapMethod(array('m'));
